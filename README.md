# Mylar Bag Label Generator for Filament

This is a project to generate a page that allows users to generate labels for mylar bags.

Labels are to be printed on "free" shipping labels from USPS, UPS, or FedEx or non-free shipping labels from anywhere.

Input is a URL to bambu store like https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pla-basic-filament?id=40475106640008

Output is a HTML page that prints a label twice. Label has the name of the filament, the image of the filament, and source of the filament. Consider the page to be Letter but if there's a way to make it handle other sizes, that's a bonus.
